DBIx/Perform version 0.01
=========================


DBIx::Perform - Informix Perform(tm) emulator


Emulates the Informix Perform character-terminal-based database query
and update utility.  

DESCRIPTION

The filename given to the I<perform> command may be a Perform
specification (.per) file.  The call to the I<run> function may be a
filename of a .per file or of a file pre-digested by the
DBIx::Perform::DigestPer class (extension .pps).  [Using pre-digested
files does not appreciably speed things up, so this feature is not highly recommended.]

The argument to the I<run> function may also be a string holding the
contents of a .per or .pps file, or a hash ref with the contents of a
.pps file (keys db, screen, tables, attrs).

The database named in the screen spec may be a DBI connect argument, or
just a database name.  In that case, the database type is taken from
environment variable DB_CLASS.  The username and password are taken from
DB_USER and DB_PASSWORD, respectively.

Supports the following features of Informix's Perform:

 Field Attributes: COLOR, NOENTRY, NOUPDATE, DEFAULT, UPSHIFT, DOWNSHIFT,
		   INCLUDE, COMMENTS

 2-table Master/Detail  (though no query in detail mode)

 VERY simple control blocks (nextfield= and let f1 = f2 op f3-or-constant)
